\section{Infomation}

Apvlv is a open source software, and was created by Alf. Now, it is still growing.

Like the name, Apvlv makes people reading their PDF files just like using Vim.

So, Apvlv bindings lots of Vim command and its behaviour is like Vim. For example, $<$Ctrl-f$>$ to forward page, $<$Ctrl-b$>$ to previous page, 'k','j','h','l' to scrolling a page up, down, left or right, and so on. 

And, Apvlv can understand that how many times you want to run the command.

The only thing you need to do is typing the number before the command. For example, typing '50' and $<$Ctrl-f$>$ will go forward 50 pages, typing '30' and $<$Ctrl-b$>$ will go previous 30 pages.

What's more important, Apvlv can understand negative numbers too. If it got '-50' and 'Ctrl-B', PDF document will go FORWARD (preward -50) 50 pages. For example, typing '50g' will goto the 50th page, and typing '-50g' will go to the 50th page from the last page to count.

Do you like it? If yes, continue read the help document.
